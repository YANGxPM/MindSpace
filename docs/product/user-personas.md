She's isolated in the lab, working odd hours, and questioning if the PhD is worth it. She's from a family of doctors and feels pressure to finish, but imposter syndrome is overwhelming.

But the reality is brutal: constant travel, impossible client demands, weekend work, and a culture of "grinding." They're in the office or on Zoom until 11pm most nights.
